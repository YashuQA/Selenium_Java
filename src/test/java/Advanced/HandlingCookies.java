	 * HTTP Cookie = user info + their preferences Used to communicate between
	 * different web pages. Purpose of cookies is rapid interactions between pages.
	 * Also called as user's identity. Stores in the form of Key-value pairs(text
	 * file) A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored in a text file
	 * on userâ€™s (client) hard drive by the web server. It happenes while the user
	 * is browsing that website. Cookies consists of 1. name of the server the
	 * cookie was sent 2.Cookies LifeTime 3.A Value(randomly generated unique
	 * number)
	 * 
	 * Types of Cookies : 1.Session Cookies(Browser is closed the session will be
	 * closed) 2.Persistent Cookies(permanently written on the user machine it lasts
	 * for months or years)
	 * 
	 * driver.manage().getCookies(); ---> Return the list of all cookies.
	 * driver.manage().getCookieName(arg0); ---> Return specific cookie according to
	 * the name driver.manage().addCookie(arg0); ---> Create and add the cookie
	 * driver.manage().deleteCookie(arg0); --->Delete specific cookie
	 * driver.manage().deletedCookieName(arg0); --->Delete specific cookie according
	 * name driver.manage().deleteAllCookies(); --->Delete all cookies
	 * 
	 * Why handle cookies in selenium? 1.When Testing a web application using
	 * selenium web driver, you may need to create, update or delete a cookie. 2.If
	 * cookies are not stored, you will need to perform login action every time
	 * before you execute above listed test scenarios. This will increase your
	 * coding effort and execution time. Solution is to sstore these cookies in file
	 * and later retrieve the values of cookies from their file and add to it your
	 * current browser session has this information in it.
